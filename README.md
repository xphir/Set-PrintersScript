# Set-PrintersScript
A PowerShell script that will remove and install printers based on a supplied JSON file

## Background
We used this script for our remote users (on thin clients) as we found the built in microsoft group policies had issues always working (sometimes users printers wouldnt install, or would retain printer from a previous session) so we implemented this script to make things simpler.

This has been live for over 2 years in our network, as has no issues once we finished the code

## How to
